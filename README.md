# Force Touch JavaScript Implementation 

Influenced by [this 3D Touch webapp](http://freinbichler.me/apps/3dtouch/) 

Visit [this page](https://jake-g.github.io/iPhonePressure/) on your 3D Touch enabled device (for example, iPhone 6s or newer) to try it.

This project uses the `touchforcechange` event on iOS 10 and uses a timeout-based version as a fallback on older iOS versions.
